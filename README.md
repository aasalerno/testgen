# testtex
TestTeX is a set of scripts that are currently written in a seperate way, with the final idea being the ability for teachers to create tests with multiple versions at the click of a button.

Work needs to be done to get codes working in the first place, then getting them to work "together" to create a series of questions in an intelligent manner (ensuring that the number of questions is handled well, versions are handled, etc.)

In addition to creating the questions, the notion is that it will output TeX files (and compile them on the fly?) of tests in addition to solutions. The TeX files will be available as well should you want to make any changes to them, or just copy the mathematics/formatting to input into your own files. A TeX compiler is required on your machine locally, or you could use an online option such as Overleaf -- however, if you are using an online option, be aware that compile time can be an issue for long lists (for example, if you want 650 redox questions...)

This package requires a few things:
-periodictable
-chempy
-sympy
-numpy
-matplotlib
-scipy?
-dash or tkiter
